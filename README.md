# Proposal-Project#2:
Building a model to predict car price by importing large data from a car sales website and available csv data sets online. By using statistics and probability analysis with linear regression and converting nonnumeric values such as color of car to 0 or 1. The datasets will be obtained by applying web scraping from an American car sales website, we also might add data sets from Kaggle as well. The tools that will be used is python, pandas numPy, seaborn, matplotlib, sqlalchemy , Statsmodels.api, statsmodels.formula.api patsy and sklearn.
